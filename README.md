# Task3

This project demonstrates a variety of SQL queries executed on a groceries database, covering essential SQL concepts:

SELECT – Retrieve specific columns and rows from tables
WHERE – Filter records based on conditions
GROUP BY & HAVING – Group data and apply conditions on aggregated result
ORDER BY ASC/DESC – Sort results in ascending or descending order
LIMIT – Restrict the number of records returned

Joins:
INNER JOIN – Get records with matching values in both tables
LEFT JOIN – Get all records from the left table with matching data from the right
RIGHT JOIN – Get all records from the right table with matching data from the left
